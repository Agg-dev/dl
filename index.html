<h2 style="color: #7bf;">Description</h2>
<h3 style="color: #205080;">Withser is the final boss of DarkLands. He has alot of abilities like dash, melee and ranged attacks. Withser is a powerful boss. To fight him, you have to find the Withser block, which can be found by travelling around DarkLands. Then you need to craft a key to summon his arena alongside him. To craft the key you need to kill all mobs of darklands, meaning you have to kill each mob 9 times. In total: 81 times. Reason: if you kill any mob of darkland (expect withser), it would drop his star. For Example metal zombie drops metal zombie star After dying. The same goes with others. So you will need to kill metal zombie 9 times to get 9 metal zombie star. 1 kill = 1 mob star. The Same thing goes with other darkland mobs like trex, alligator, claw zombie, pillar zombie, saw zombie, spider zombie, knocker zombie and sword zombie. After getting 9 mob stars of each mob, you need to put all the stars in the crafting table to get 9 key fragments. 9 star of each mob = 1 key fragment. After getting 9 key fragments. You would need to put all fragments in the crafting table to get a key. After getting the key place or find Withser block. and then put the key into it's hole. Then the Withser structure will be ready. Then go into the structure and fight the boss. If you kill withser boss. Then you would get 64 Withser heads. Withser heads are very useful weapons.
